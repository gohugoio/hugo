This is the default configuration:

{{< code-toggle config=minify />}}

See the [tdewolff/minify] project page for details, but note the following:

- `css.inline` is for internal use. Changing this setting has no effect.
- `html.keepConditionalComments` has been deprecated. Use `html.keepSpecialComments` instead.
