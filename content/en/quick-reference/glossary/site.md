title: site

A _site_ is a specific instance of your [_project_](g) representing a unique combination of [_language_](g), [_role_](g), and [_version_](g). While a simple project may consist of only a single site, Hugo's multidimensional content model allows a single codebase to generate a matrix of sites simultaneously.
