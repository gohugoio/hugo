A _project_ is a collection of [_components_](g) used to generate one or more [sites](g). While a project may consist of only a single site, Hugo allows a single project to generate a matrix of sites based on [_language_](g), [role](g), and [_version_](g). The project serves as the parent container for the common assets and logic used across all sites within the build.
