A _role_ is a [_dimension_](g) that allows a logical page to be served in different forms depending on the target audience. While [_language_](g) focuses on localization and [_version_](g) focuses on lifecycle, the role dimension allows a project to generate variations of a page without duplicating content.

  See also: [_default role_](g).
