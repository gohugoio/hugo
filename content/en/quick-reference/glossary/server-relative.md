title: server-relative
---

  A _server-relative_ path is the final path from the web server's root, used in the generated site. These paths always begin with a leading slash and account for the [`baseURL`] and [_content dimension_](g) prefixes such as language, [_role_](g), or version. For example, `/en/examples/old-name/` is a server-relative path.

  See also: [_page-relative_](g), [_site-relative_](g).

  [`baseURL`]: /configuration/all/#baseurl
