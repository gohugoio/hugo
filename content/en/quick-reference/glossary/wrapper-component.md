title: wrapper component
---

A _wrapper component_ is an interface pattern that encloses other content through composition rather than fixed parameters. It provides a reusable shell to handle layout, styling, or logic, allowing the calling template to inject arbitrary content into the component's interior.

  See also: [_partial decorator_](g).
