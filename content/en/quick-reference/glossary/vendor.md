title: vendor

To _vendor_ (verb) in a software context is the process of including the source code of third-party dependencies directly within your own project's repository, rather than downloading them on the fly from an external package manager.

  When you are asked to "vendor the dependencies into the project root," you are being told to move those external libraries from a temporary cache into a dedicated folder that gets committed to your version control system.
