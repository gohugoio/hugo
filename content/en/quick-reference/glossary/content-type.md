title: content type
---

A _content type_ is a classification of content inferred from the top-level directory name or the `type` set in [_front matter_](g). Pages in the root of the `content` directory, including the home page, are of type "page". The content type is a contributing factor in the template lookup order and determines which [_archetype_](g) template to use when creating new content.
