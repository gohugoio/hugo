[Godot Tutorials](https://godottutorials.com) started as a way to teach beginners game programming and game development.
As I created videos, I ran into a problem; if I made a mistake with a YouTube video, it was difficult to correct errors.

I discovered that blogging episodes and having articles that teach on top of my videos is a fantastic solution to my problem.

As I researched blogging platforms, I came across two solutions; however, I chose [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) because it's built with Markdown in mind and simplified my workflow.

In a sense, with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) programmed the right way, I can focus **more time on planning, creating, and editing**
my videos and **less time maintaining and fixing** my website.
