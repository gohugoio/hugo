We are making an effort to unify our [terminology], and to use these terms consistently throughout the documentation.

Historically, we have inconsistently referred to the items on this page as [functions], [parameters], [variables], or [methods]. They are not functions, parameters, or variables; they are methods.

This page will remain in place as readers become familiar with the unified terminology. See the [methods section] for a list of methods by [object].

[functions]: /getting-started/glossary/#function
[methods section]: /methods
[methods]: /getting-started/glossary/#method
[object]: /getting-started/glossary/#object
[parameters]: /getting-started/glossary/#parameter
[terminology]: /getting-started/glossary/
[variable]: /getting-started/glossary/#variable
[variables]: /getting-started/glossary/#variable
