eSolia had experimented with various other site generators, both proprietary and open source, and with server-side CMSs. We wanted the superior security and performance of a static site, without having to deal with development environment dependencies, meaning having to keep various libraries updated. [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), written in the modern Go language, fits that requirement perfectly. It is not only available as a single, easy-to-install binary file for Mac, Linux and Windows, it was written to be insanely great in terms of speed and performance. Most sites build in milliseconds; in fact it takes longer to sync them to your web host than it does to generate the site! We like it so much that we built my personal site [Rick Cogley Central](http://rick.cogley.info/), eSolia's [English esolia.com](http://esolia.com/) and [Japanese esolia.co.jp](http://esolia.co.jp/) sites, and finally, eSolia's professional blog at [eSolia.pro](http://esolia.pro/) in it. As of July 2015, Hugo's community is vibrant, development is actively proceeding, and we'd love to welcome new users to the fold. Also see:[Why Hugo?
