The `time.ParseDuration` function returns a [`time.Duration`] value that you can use with any of the `Duration` [methods].

A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as `300ms`, `-1.5h` or `2h45m`. Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `Âµs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`.

This template:

```go-html-template
{{ $duration := time.ParseDuration "24h" }}
{{ printf "There are %.0f seconds in one day." $duration.Seconds }}
```

Is rendered to:

```text
There are 86400 seconds in one day.
```
