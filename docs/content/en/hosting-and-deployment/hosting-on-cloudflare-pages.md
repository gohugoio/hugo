[Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/) are super fast, always up-to-date, and deployed directly from your Git provider (currently supports only GitHub and GitLab).

Cloudflare Pages docs have a detailed tutorial on [how to deploy a Hugo site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-hugo-site/).
