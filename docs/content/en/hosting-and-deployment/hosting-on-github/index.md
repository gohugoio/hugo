## Prerequisites

Please complete the following tasks before continuing:

1. [Create a GitHub account]
1. [Install Git]
1. [Create a Hugo site] and test it locally with `hugo server`.

[Create a GitHub account]: https://github.com/signup
[Install Git]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
[Create a Hugo site]: /getting-started/quick-start/

## Types of sites

There are three types of GitHub Pages sites: project, user, and organization. Project sites are connected to a specific project hosted on GitHub. User and organization sites are connected to a specific account on GitHub.com.

See the [GitHub Pages documentation] to understand the requirements for repository ownership and naming.

## Procedure

Step 1
: Create a GitHub repository.

Step 2
: Push your local repository to GitHub.

Step 3
: Visit your GitHub repository. From the main menu choose **Settings**&nbsp;>&nbsp;**Pages**. In the center of your screen you will see this:

![screen capture](gh-pages-1.png)
{style="max-width: 280px"}

Step 4
: Change the **Source** to `GitHub Actions`. The change is immediate; you do not have to press a Save button.

![screen capture](gh-pages-2.png)
{style="max-width: 280px"}

Step 5
: Create a file named `hugo.yaml` in a directory named `.github/workflows`.

```text
mkdir -p .github/workflows
touch hugo.yaml
```

Step 6
: Copy and paste the YAML below into the file you created. Change the branch name and Hugo version as needed.

# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Hugo site to GitHub Pages
name: Deploy Hugo site to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches:
      - main

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

# Default to bash
defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash

jobs:
  # Build job
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      HUGO_VERSION: 0.141.0
    steps:
      - name: Install Hugo CLI
        run: |
          wget -O ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v${HUGO_VERSION}/hugo_extended_${HUGO_VERSION}_linux-amd64.deb \
          && sudo dpkg -i ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb
      - name: Install Dart Sass
        run: sudo snap install dart-sass
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          submodules: recursive
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Setup Pages
        id: pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
      - name: Install Node.js dependencies
        run: "[[ -f package-lock.json || -f npm-shrinkwrap.json ]] && npm ci || true"
      - name: Build with Hugo
        env:
          HUGO_CACHEDIR: ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo_cache
          HUGO_ENVIRONMENT: production
          TZ: America/Los_Angeles
        run: |
          hugo \
            --gc \
            --minify \
            --baseURL "${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_url }}/"
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v4
        with:
          path: ./public

  # Deployment job
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
{{< /code >}}

Step 7
: Commit and push the change to your GitHub repository.

```sh
git add -A
git commit -m "Create hugo.yaml"
git push
```

Step 8
: From GitHub's main menu, choose **Actions**. You will see something like this:

![screen capture](gh-pages-3.png)
{style="max-width: 350px"}

Step 9
: When GitHub has finished building and deploying your site, the color of the status indicator will change to green.

![screen capture](gh-pages-4.png)
{style="max-width: 350px"}

Step 10
: Click on the commit message as shown above. You will see this:

![screen capture](gh-pages-5.png)
{style="max-width: 611px"}

Under the deploy step, you will see a link to your live site.

In the future, whenever you push a change from your local repository, GitHub will rebuild your site and deploy the changes.

## Customize the workflow

The example workflow above includes this step, which typically takes 10&#8209;15 seconds:

```yaml
- name: Install Dart Sass
  run: sudo snap install dart-sass
```

You may remove this step if your site, themes, and modules do not transpile Sass to CSS using the [Dart Sass] transpiler.
