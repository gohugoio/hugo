To complete this showcase:

1. Write the story about your site in this file.
1. Add a summary to the `bio.md` file in this directory.
1. Replace the `featured-template.png` with a screenshot of your site. You can rename it, but it must contain the word `featured`.
1. Create a new pull request in <https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/pulls>

The content of this bundle explained:

index.md
: The main content file. Fill in required front matter metadata and write your story. I does not have to be a novel. It can even be self-promotional, but it should include Hugo in some form.

bio.md
: A short summary of the website. Site credits (who built it) fits nicely here.

featured.png
: A reasonably sized screenshot of your website. It can be named anything, but the name must start with "featured". The sample image is `1500x750` (2:1 aspect ratio).
