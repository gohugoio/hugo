title: site

A _site_ is a specific instance of your project representing a unique combination of language, [_role_](g), and version. While a simple project may consist of only a single site, Hugo's multidimensional content model allows a single codebase to generate a matrix of sites simultaneously. Each site operates with its own configuration, set of pages, and output destination, allowing you to serve tailored content to different audiences from one unified source.
