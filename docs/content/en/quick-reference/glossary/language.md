A _language_ is a [_dimension_](g) that facilitates the localization and internationalization of content. While [_version_](g) focuses on lifecycle and [_role_](g) focuses on audience, the language dimension allows a logical page to be represented in different locales across the project.

  See also: [_default language_](g).
