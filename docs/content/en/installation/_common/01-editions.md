## Editions

Hugo is available in two editions: standard and extended. With the extended edition you can:

- Encode to the WebP format when [processing images]. You can decode WebP images with either edition.
- [Transpile Sass to CSS] using the embedded LibSass transpiler. The extended edition is not required to use the [Dart Sass] transpiler.

We recommend that you install the extended edition.

[dart sass]: /hugo-pipes/transpile-sass-to-css/#dart-sass
[processing images]: /content-management/image-processing/
[transpile sass to css]: /hugo-pipes/transpile-sass-to-css/
