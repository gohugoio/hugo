Hugo ships with support for [Disqus](https://disqus.com/), a third-party service that provides comment and community capabilities to websites via JavaScript.

Your theme may already support Disqus, but if not, it is easy to add to your templates via [Hugo's built-in Disqus partial][disquspartial].

## Add Disqus

Hugo comes with all the code you need to load Disqus into your templates. Before adding Disqus to your site, you'll need to [set up an account][disqussetup].

### Configure Disqus

Disqus comments require you set a single value in your [site's configuration file][configuration] like so:

{{< code-toggle file=hugo >}}
[services.disqus]
shortname = 'your-disqus-shortname'
{{</ code-toggle >}}

For many websites, this is enough configuration. However, you also have the option to set the following in the [front matter] of a single content file:

- `disqus_identifier`
- `disqus_title`
- `disqus_url`

### Render Hugo's built-in Disqus partial template

Disqus has its own [internal template](/templates/embedded/#disqus) available, to render it add the following code where you want comments to appear:

```go-html-template
{{ partial "disqus.html" . }}
```
