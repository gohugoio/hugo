Hugo provides a robust theming system which is simple, yet capable of producing
even the most complicated websites.

The Hugo community has created a set of themes ready for using in your own
site.

Hugo themes have been designed to be the perfect balance between
simplicity and functionality. Hugo themes are powered by the excellent
Go template library. If you are new to Go templates, see our [primer on
Go templates](/templates/go-templates/).

Hugo themes support all modern features you come to expect. They are
structured in such a way to eliminate code duplication. Themes are also
designed to be very easy to customize while retaining the ability to
maintain upgradeability as the upstream theme changes.

Hugo currently doesn’t ship with a “default” theme, allowing the user to
pick whichever theme best suits their project.

We hope you will find Hugo themes perfect for your site.
