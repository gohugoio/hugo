  Most of the commands for **Hugo Modules** require a newer version (>= 1.18) of Go installed (see https://golang.org/dl/) and the relevant VCS client (e.g. Git, see https://git-scm.com/downloads/ ).
  If you have an "older" site running on Netlify, you may have to set GO_VERSION to 1.19 or newer in your Environment settings.
