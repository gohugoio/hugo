## Hugo Docs POC

See the concept live at <https://hugodocs.info>.

**CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT.**

This is *not* a new theme or skin for the [current website](https://gohugo.io). It is a **complete reworking of the Hugo documentation**.

I originally posed a source reorganization of the current website in this Discuss thread in November 2016 here:

<https://discuss.gohugo.io/t/proposed-source-organization-for-hugo-docs-concept/4506>

I reorganized the docs content and realized it did very little to make the documentation more intelligible or intuitive.

So, I'm running with it...

TODO:
Fix theme /content/content-management/archetypes.md where theme is indicated
Fix theme /content/contribute/documentation.md where theme is indicated
Fix theme /content/templates/files.md where theme is indicated
